# cognifyz_level1_task2

in this task2 of level 1 :
1. i have developed a basic button that changes its color when clicked using javascript
2. created an alert box that displays a greeting message based on the current time using javascript.
3. built a basic calculator that adds two numbers, performs different operations on the numbers and displays the result using javascript.

the task was quite challenging that pushes my coding skills and creativity to a new height.
